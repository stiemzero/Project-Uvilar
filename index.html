            <h1 class="text-center">Statistics</h1>
            <p>
                Each character has a number of stats that determine their abilities and worth in their field of work.
                These stats are the main ones with smaller ones being able to be created when needed for characters that
                require them.
                <br>
                Each player gets a normal distribution for their stats to know what they are good at. This can very
                greatly, so make smart use of your character while it's alive.
                <br>
                A character can also be taught to increase their stats to a cap of 4. After this they will require
                active use of these stats to increase them.
                <br><br>

                These stats are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-decoration-underline">Leadership</span>
                    : This shows how well your character can lead a group of people. Be it as a nation or a company,
                    having a high leadership is always handy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-decoration-underline">Land</span>
                    : Your character's ability to plan army tactics and lead in land combat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-decoration-underline">Water</span>
                    : The ability for your character to command ships and plan for sea combat.
                </li>

            <p>
                <br>
                Other stats characters have are things like infancy, which shows how feared or loved your character is,
                or money that your character has.
                <br>
                Then there also is the extra info about your character. This can be anything from what they owe, to
                battle wounds they have from combat.
