<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nations can come about in many ways. The most basic way is by tribes expanding. Each nation will be led by one or multiple characters. Their leadership and fame determines how the nation runs and how others see it. A nation has the following info.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Nation Administration</strong></h2>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Nation info</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These determine a large amount of your nation and you&rsquo;ll need to keep an eye on these. The higher amounts are the better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop: the amount of people living in your nation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">pop is split into two types</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">City pop. These live in the cities and work more specialized jobs. they have a smaller impact on the governing capacity&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spread out pop. These live in the country land. They provide food and basic resources for the cities around them and have a larger impact on governing capacity</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities: the amount of cities in your nation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">governing: this shows how well your nation can govern itself. if it&rsquo;s low your nation loses stability</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Nation status</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This contains useful info that has larger effects on your nation. These will be kept hidden for the player but will become visible using events that happen along the way. these are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stability: how well your country is doing. The lower this is, the more likely a rebellion or civil war is.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">War support: people don&rsquo;t like being at war. this determines how much your nation&rsquo;s opinion of it is right now</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Nation Statistics</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In here you can find all the info about how much a nation produces and owns. the first few numbers are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxation: how much each pop gives the state per week</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research: how many research points you gain per week</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">civics points: how many civic points you gain per week</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the nation's resources follow. These will always be 2 rows, the first row being how much is gained per week. the second being how much they have in total. After all that the districts follow. This shows how many districts you have of each type.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal starts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nations that do not start from other places there is the tribal start. These will be split in a few types that players can choose from that align with their lore. Each giving slightly different starter effects.</span></p>
